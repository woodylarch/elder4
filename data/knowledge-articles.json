This guide will help you navigate your new responsibilities.</p><h3>Getting Recognized as a Carer</h3><p>Register with your GP as a carer and request a carer's assessment from your local council. This assessment will identify what support you need, regardless of your income.</p><h3>Understanding the Person's Needs</h3><p>Speak with healthcare professionals to understand the medical needs of the person you're caring for. Ask about their condition, medications, potential side effects, and warning signs to watch for.</p><h3>Setting Up a Routine</h3><p>Establish a consistent daily routine that works for both of you. Include time for medications, meals, exercise, social activities, and rest periods.</p><h3>Essential Equipment and Adaptations</h3><p>Consider what practical equipment might be needed, such as mobility aids, bathroom adaptations, or special bedding. An occupational therapist can assess home needs.</p><h3>Emergency Planning</h3><p>Create an emergency plan with contact information for healthcare providers, medication details, and alternative care arrangements.</p><h3>Looking After Yourself</h3><p>Remember that your wellbeing matters too. Identify sources of support for yourself, join a local carers group, and schedule regular breaks.</p>",

This guide explains everything you need to know about claiming this important financial support.</p><h3>What is Carer's Allowance?</h3><p>Carer's Allowance is a payment of £76.75 per week (as of April 2023) for people who spend at least 35 hours a week caring for someone who receives certain disability benefits.</p><h3>Eligibility Requirements</h3><p>To qualify for Carer's Allowance, you must:</p><ul><li>Spend at least 35 hours a week caring for someone</li><li>Care for someone who receives certain disability benefits (such as Attendance Allowance or PIP daily living component)</li><li>Be 16 or over</li><li>Not be in full-time education</li><li>Not earn more than £139 per week (after deductions)</li><li>Meet UK residency requirements</li></ul><h3>How to Apply</h3><p>You can apply online at gov.uk/carers-allowance, by phone (0800 731 0297), or by post using a claim form. You'll need details about yourself, the person you care for, and other benefits either of you receive.</p><h3>Effect on Other Benefits</h3><p>Carer's Allowance can affect other benefits you or the person you care for receives. It counts as taxable income and may affect means-tested benefits like Universal Credit. If the person you care for receives a severe disability premium, they may lose this if you claim Carer's Allowance.</p><h3>Underlying Entitlement</h3><p>Even if you can't receive Carer's Allowance payments (perhaps because you receive another benefit that 'overlaps' with it), you may have an 'underlying entitlement' that can increase other means-tested benefits you receive.</p><h3>Regular Reviews</h3><p>Your entitlement will be reviewed periodically, and you must report any changes in your circumstances promptly to avoid overpayments.</p>",

An LPA cannot be set up once someone has lost capacity to make their own decisions.</p><h3>The Application Process</h3><p>To set up an LPA, you need to:</p><ol><li>Get the LPA forms from the Office of the Public Guardian or complete them online</li><li>Have the person (donor) choose their attorney(s) and specify how decisions should be made</li><li>Get a 'certificate provider' to confirm the donor understands the LPA and isn't being pressured</li><li>Register the LPA with the Office of the Public Guardian (this takes 8-10 weeks and costs £82 per LPA)</li></ol><h3>Your Responsibilities as an Attorney</h3><p>As an attorney, you must:</p><ul><li>Always act in the best interests of the donor</li><li>Consider the donor's wishes and feelings</li><li>Help them make their own decisions where possible</li><li>Keep the donor's money separate from your own</li><li>Keep accurate records of decisions and transactions</li></ul><h3>What If There's No LPA?</h3><p>If someone loses capacity without an LPA in place, you may need to apply to the Court of Protection to become a deputy, which is more complex and expensive.</p><h3>Getting Help</h3><p>Consider seeking advice from a solicitor, especially for complex situations. Organizations like Age UK and Citizens Advice can also provide guidance.</p>",

Understanding this complex process can make a substantial difference to care options and finances.</p><h3>What is NHS Continuing Healthcare?</h3><p>CHC is care provided and fully funded by the NHS for individuals whose primary need is health-related. It can cover care at home or in a care home and is not means-tested, unlike local authority social care.</p><h3>Who Might Be Eligible?</h3><p>Eligibility is based on having a 'primary health need' rather than specific conditions. Assessment considers the:</p><ul><li>Nature of needs (the characteristics and type of care required)</li><li>Complexity (how different needs interact)</li><li>Intensity (the severity and required level of care)</li><li>Unpredictability (how difficult needs are to manage or anticipate)</li></ul><p>Those nearing end of life may be eligible for a Fast Track assessment.</p><h3>The Assessment Process</h3><h4>Step 1: Initial Checklist</h4><p>A health or social care professional completes an initial screening tool (the Checklist). If this indicates possible eligibility, they'll refer for a full assessment.</p><h4>Step 2: Full Assessment</h4><p>A multidisciplinary team (MDT) of health and social care professionals conducts a detailed assessment using the Decision Support Tool (DST). This evaluates needs across 12 care domains including:</p><ul><li>Breathing</li><li>Nutrition</li><li>Continence</li><li>Mobility</li><li>Cognition</li><li>Behavior</li><li>Medication management</li><li>And others</li></ul><h4>Step 3: Decision</h4><p>The MDT makes a recommendation to the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), who makes the final decision. You should be informed in writing with detailed reasons.</p><h3>If Funding is Approved</h3><p>The NHS will work with you to arrange a care package that meets assessed needs. This might be in a care home or at home. Regular reviews will assess if needs have changed.</p><h3>If Funding is Declined</h3><p>You have the right to appeal through:</p><ol><li>An informal resolution meeting with the CCG</li><li>A formal local appeal process</li><li>If still unresolved, requesting an independent review from NHS England</li><li>As a final step, approaching the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman</li></ol><h3>Tips for the Process</h3><ul><li>Keep detailed records of health needs and care provided</li><li>Gather evidence from all healthcare professionals involved</li><li>Attend the assessment meeting and consider bringing an advocate</li><li>Understand the eligibility criteria before the assessment</li><li>Consider getting expert advice from organizations like Beacon CHC</li></ul>",
