This is a placeholder file for the downloadable resource packs.

In a production environment, this would be replaced with actual PDF resources containing valuable information for elder care providers.

The Elder Care Directory provides comprehensive guides on:
- New Carer's Guide to Eldercare
- Legal Rights & Power of Attorney Guide
- Financial Support & Benefits Handbook
- Dementia Care Essentials
- Nutrition & Meal Planning for Elderly Care
- Home Safety & Accessibility Modifications
- Carer Wellbeing & Self-Care Strategies

These resources are designed to support unpaid carers in the UK who are caring for elderly loved ones.
